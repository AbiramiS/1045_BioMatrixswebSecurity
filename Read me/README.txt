6. About (Short Description / Summary):

	This project focuses on the use of unique human characteristics to recognize the users and provide a secured access to web services that are restricted, using a mobile phone with Internet connection. The mobile phone is used as a biometric capturing device, which is later used for recognition too.



	In this growing era, mobile devices have both the network access and computing capacity to provide users with a diverse range of services. So, with increasing functionality and access to personal and sensitive information, there is an essential need for enhancing/advancing the authentication mechanisms. Hence, this project proposes to present mobile phone application architecture to capture and send the biometric to the web server based on the use of embedded web browsers.
